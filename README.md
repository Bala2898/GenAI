# GenAI

This project demonstrates a basic chat completion function using the `@google/generative-ai` module.  
You can pass a prompt as a parameter to the function, and it will return a response generated by the `gemini-2.0-flash` model.  

Error handling is also included to catch and log any issues that occur during execution.
